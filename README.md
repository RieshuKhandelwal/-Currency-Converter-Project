# Currency Converter Project

## Description
This project is a web-based application that allows users to convert one type of currency to another. The application fetches the latest exchange rates from an API and performs the conversion based on the user's input.

## Files
The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page. It includes a form for users to input the amount they want to convert and select the currencies they want to convert from and to. It also displays the conversion rate.

- `style.css`: This CSS file contains styles for various elements such as the body, container, form, input fields, dropdown, select-container, and button. It defines the look and feel of the currency converter.

- `codes.js`: This JavaScript file contains a list of currency codes mapped to their respective country codes. This is used to determine which countries use which currencies.

- `app.js`: This JavaScript file contains the main application logic. It handles user interactions, updates the flags based on the selected currency, fetches the exchange rates from an API, performs the currency conversion, and updates the display with the conversion result.

## Setup
To run this project, you simply need to clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage
To use the currency converter, enter the amount you want to convert, select the currency you want to convert from and the currency you want to convert to. Click on 'Get Exchange Rate' to get the conversion rate. The converted amount will be displayed on the screen.
